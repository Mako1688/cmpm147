				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This infinite world of land and water is generated through a seed and is customizable with ships and castles.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Through this experiment I have bettered my understanding of hash tables as well as infinite spaces and how to generate the. I have also furthered my knowledge of seed generation and pseudo randomness. The waves are generated through the hashtable with updating offsets to simulate ocean motion. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I am very proud of this project and how it turned out. I spent a lot of time on the motion of the waves and the ships atop them. I think the scene looks very pleasant and works great.</p>
