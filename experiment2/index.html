			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The program uses generative methods from shape definition, mathmatical equations to ensure proper spawning for the trees and mountain peaks, and color generation with bounds in order to get certain color ranges for each object. The "cars" (represented by the moving diamonds on the road) also have their own logic from size manipulation to movement speed changing in order to ensure speed changes as they move towards the horizon.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This code was very difficult to work on as it was my first real art project done in p5.js. I would say the hardest part about the project was getting the movement of the cars and the placement of the trees working.</p>
